# Web Development by Chazona Baum

## Description
In a competitive, fast-paced tech environment, employers are constantly looking for talent with great coding potential. Typically, entering computer science students presented a unique challenge. *"Do you even code, bro?"* hiring managers would think to themselves.

This website, updated in 2017 during my studies with [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com), is designed to remove some of the doubt from my own candidacy. While I do not claim to be an expert, this site and its accompanying source code will give a good idea of the kinds of things I *can* do.

## Usage
Does this website inspire you to go out there and create your own, unleashing your projects and websites before the masses? Great! Feel free to fork this repository if you like the overall structure, and just be sure to change out the code, canonical links, etc. Really make it your own.

If you're more interested in specific code I've written to create this work, feel free to look through it. Bear in mind some code camp style curriculums may stipulate that you write your own code first before looking at someone else's source. And blatant copy-pasting is really not cool, mainly for you because you won't learn anything from it.

## Contributing
You'd like to contribute to my website repo? I'm flattered. While this repository is specifically geared to showing my work, there are a couple of really great ways to contribute:

### Reporting Bugs
See something that doesn't look or work the way it should? Please feel free to open an issue on the topic. Including helpful information like what OS and browser you're using, steps you took that produced the problem, what you expected to see and why, and any applicable screenshots or GIFs will help ensure I can address the issue and properly resolve it.

### Suggesting Enhancements
Think there's some cool feature that a project should be able to do? Awesome! Open an issue and describe what the enhancement is and why it would be useful.

## Credits
This website is thanks in large part to [Free Code Camp](https://freecodecamp.com) and its community of budding developers, without whom I would not be this far along with my code progress. Thanks as well to [Quincy Larson](https://twitter.com/ossia) for establishing this program and community in the first place.

The current redesign came about as a part of the #30Days30Sites challenge created by [Tris](https://github.com/techwithtris).

Design choices were made to ensure the site would pair well with business cards cards I have ordered in a [design](https://www.moo.com/us/design-templates/standard-size-business-cards/pack/colourlovers-champions.html) by [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/). Thus, the web design is loosely inspired by the cards.
